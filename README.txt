The Formatter Settings module is a spiritual backport of the Drupal 7 Field
Formatter Settings functionality for Drupal 6, adding two new Formatter hooks
to provide user definable settings for Formatters on a contextual basis.

This module is primarily for developers as it doesn't do anyting other than
provide the Formatter Settings hooks and modify the Display Settings UI if
Formatter Settings are present on the selected Formatter.

Formatter Settings was written and is maintained by Stuart Clark (deciphered).
